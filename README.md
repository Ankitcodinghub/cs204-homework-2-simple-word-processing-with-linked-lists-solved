Introduction

In this homework, you are asked to implement a simple word processor that will read two words from two different files and store them in two linked lists character by character. Your program will also process these lists by reading certain commands such as for inserting, deleting characters and finding the level of similarity between two words. After each command, some outputs regarding the operation will be displayed. The program details will be explained in the subsequent sections.

The Data Structure to be used

In this homework, you must use linked list (regular one-way linked list) as your main data structure. The node struct of this list must have the following data members (if you want, you can add constructors to the struct).

struct node {

Figure 1. The minimal data members that the node should have

};

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 2">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
In this struct, ch stores one character of a word, and next pointer points to the next node in the linked list.

You are not allowed to use arrays, vectors or any similar containers (including files) in this homework; all data must be stored and processed within the linked list structure. Moreover, you are not allowed to use string to store the data that you will read from the files; strings can only be used to read the file names and the commands/arguments from the keyboard.

The input data will be given to the program using text files. A screenshot of a sample input file named in1.txt and the final structure of the linked list after reading the letters from this file are shown in

Figure 2.

Reading the Files and Creating the Linked Lists

Your program will start by asking the user to enter two file names, one by one. For each of these files, first you should check if it is opened successfully or not. If not opened, you have to read another file name.

Then, your program should read the contents of these two files and store each file‚Äôs content in a separate linked list character by character as described above.

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 3">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Each file has one word, which is lined up vertically and each line has only one character. This is an assumption and you do not have to make an input check for this. We also assume that:

<ul>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;The file does not contain empty lines or whitespaces.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;The file contains only lowercase English letters (i.e., from a to z).</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;The file may contain duplicate letters.</li>
<li>ÔÇ∑ &nbsp;The file is not empty and may contain any number of letters.These are the assumptions and you do not need to make an input check for the content of the files (but there will be some input checks for the commands and arguments as detailed below).In order to store the contents of two files, you need to have two different linked lists with different head pointers. For each of the files, you will read file‚Äôs content line by line (i.e. letter by letter) and append each letter read to the end of the corresponding linked list. After that, your linked lists become ready to be processed with some commands as described below.
Operations/Commands to be Performed on the Linked Lists

After reading the data from the two files and storing them in two linked lists, first, you have to display the contents of the lists one by one. After that, your program will keep asking the user to enter a command followed by its arguments, if any. Basically, these commands are for inserting and deleting characters from the linked lists, finding similarity between two lists, and for exiting the program. Insertion and deletion commands also indicate the linked list number that this operation will be performed on (i.e., whether it is the linked list 1 or the linked list 2). Thus, we have a total of six commands that your program should support: del1, del2, insert1, insert2, sim, and exit.
</li>
</ul>
ÔÇ∑ del1 and del2 commands are followed by one argument, which is the letter to be deleted from the corresponding list. This command will delete all of the nodes that contain the given letter in the argumentfromthespecifiedlinkedlist.Forexample,ifthelistcontainsl l a m aandifthe argument is l, then the list will contain a m a. As another example, if another list contains

g o o g l e, and if the argument was g then the list will contain o o l e.

If the letter to be deleted does not exist in the list, then nothing will be deleted and a message that explains this has to be displayed. You have to display an output about the operation details and the content of the list after deletion. Please see the sample runs for example outputs. Other details about deletion are as follows.

o del1 will apply the deletion operation on the linked list 1.

o del2 will apply the deletion operation on the linked list 2.

o The command and argument are separated by at least one whitespace and the argument is

only one character. These are assumptions and you do not need to make input check for

those.

o The argument should be a lowercase letter and you have to do an input check for this.

ÔÇ∑ insert1 and insert2 commands are followed by two arguments, which have to be lowercase English letters. The first argument indicates the letter to be inserted after the first occurrence (just after first occurrence, not after all of the occurrences) of a node that contains the letter specified as the second argument. If the linked list does not contain a node with the second argument, then the program should insert the node that contains the first argument to the beginning of the linked list (i.e., it will become the head node). For example, if the list contains a l b a l a and if the arguments are t and l, then after insertion the list will contain a l t b a l a. As another example, suppose you insert once again to this updated list with arguments b and s; the list will contain

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 4">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
b a l t b a l aafterinsertion;hereweinsertedbtothebeginningsincetherewasnos. You have to display an output about the operation details and the content of the list after insertion. Please see the sample runs for example outputs. Other details about insertion are as follows.

o insert1 will apply the insertion operation on linked list 1.

o insert2 will apply the insertion operation on linked list 2.

o The command and the arguments are separated by at least one whitespace and each

argument is only one character. These are assumptions and you do not need to make input

check for those.

o The arguments should be lowercase letters and you have to do input check for this.

ÔÇ∑ sim does not take any argument. It is an abbreviation for similarity, and when the user enters this command the program will count and display the total number of matching letters in the same positions in both lists. For example, if the first list contains a l k i and the second list contains e l t i k, the similarity value is 2 since the letters l and i match in the same positions. This command should display this similarity value and also the current contents of the lists. Here be careful that the lists may have different sizes, so you have to stop checking once you reach NULL in one of them.

ÔÇ∑ exit command indicates that the program will end. At this point, the program will stop asking the user for more commands and clear both of the lists by properly deleting all the memory allocated for them.

If the user enters an invalid command and/or invalid argument(s), your program should give an error message and continue by reading new commands and arguments.

If the command is entered correctly, you may assume that the number of arguments is also correct (no input check needed); that means please assume that there are two arguments for insertion, one argument for deletion and no argument for similarity and exit. The only input check for the arguments is that they have to be lowercase letters (as mentioned above).

You have to ignore all of the extra characters that might appear after an invalid command in the input line so that the next command is read fresh. You can do so by using the command cin.ignore(numeric_limits&lt;streamsize&gt;::max(),‚Äô\n‚Äô);

CAUTION

One of the lists or both of them may become empty during the execution of the program due to delete operations. Your program should keep processing commands in such a case as well. Please note that if one or both of the lists is/are empty, then similarity value should be zero, by definition of similarity.

Some Important Rules

In order to get a full credit, your programs must be efficient and well presented, presence of any redundant computation or unnecessary memory usage or bad indentation, or missing, irrelevant comments are going to decrease your grades. You also have to use understandable identifier names, informative introduction and prompts. Modularity is also important; you have to use functions wherever needed and appropriate.

Since you will use dynamic memory allocation in this homework, it is very crucial to properly manage the allocated area and return the deleted parts to the heap whenever appropriate. Inefficient use of memory may reduce your grade.

When we grade your homework, we pay attention to these issues. Moreover, in order to observe the real performance of your codes, we may run your programs in Release mode and we may test your programs with very large test cases. Of course, your program should work in Debug mode as well.

Please do not use any non-ASCII characters (Turkish or other) in your code.

You are allowed to use sample codes shared with the class by the instructor and TAs. However, you cannot start with an existing .cpp or .h file directly and update it; you have start with an empty file. Only the necessary parts of the shared code files can be used and these parts must be clearly marked in your homework by putting comments like the following. Even if you take a piece of code and update it slightly, you have to put a similar marking (by adding ‚Äúand updated‚Äù to the comments below.

<pre>/* Begin: code taken from ptrfunc.cpp */
</pre>
‚Ä¶

<pre>/* End: code taken from ptrfunc.cpp */
</pre>
What and where to submit (PLEASE READ, IMPORTANT) ‚Äì Same as before

You should prepare (or at least test) your program using MS Visual Studio C++. We recommend using 2012 version; however, if you use another version provided by Sabancƒ± University software repository, it is OK as long as you specify which version you use at the beginning of your program. We will use the standard C++ compiler and libraries of the abovementioned platform while testing your homework. It‚Äôd be a good idea to write your name and last name in the program (as a comment line of course). Using other platforms (Xcode, VSCode, etc.) is risky and may cause some incompatibility problems.

Submissions guidelines are below. Some parts of the grading process might be automatic. Students are expected to strictly follow these guidelines in order to have a smooth grading process. If you do not follow these guidelines, depending on the severity of the problem created during the grading process, 5 or more penalty points are to be deducted from the grade.

Name your cpp file that contains your main program using the following convention:

‚ÄúSUCourseUserName_YourLastname_YourNames_HWnumber.cpp‚Äù

Your SUCourse user name is your SUNet user name which is used for checking sabanciuniv e-mails (not the numeric one). Do NOT use any spaces, non-ASCII and Turkish characters in the file name. For example, if your SUCourse user name is cago, name is CÃßagÃÜlayan, and last name is OÃàzbugsƒ±zkodyazarogÃÜlu, then the file name must be:

Cago_Ozbugsizkodyazaroglu_Caglayan_hw2.cpp

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 11">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Actually, it does not matter whether you use uppercase of lowercase letters in the file names.

In some homework assignments, you may need to have more than one .cpp or .h files to submit. In this case, add informative phrases after the hw number. However, do not add any other character or phrase to the file names. Sometimes, you may want to use some user defined libraries (such as strutils of Tapestry); in such cases, you have to provide the necessary .cpp and .h files of them as well. If you use standard C++ libraries, you do not need to provide extra files for them.

In some homework assignments, you may need to have more than one .cpp or .h files to submit. In this case, use the same filename format but add informative phrases after the hw number (e.g. Cago_Ozbugsizkodyazaroglu_Caglayan_hw2_myfuncs.cpp or Cago_Ozbugsizkodyazaroglu_Caglayan_hw2_myfuncs.h). However, do not add any other character or phrase to the file names. Sometimes, you may want to use some user defined libraries (such as strutils of Tapestry); in such cases, you have to provide the necessary .cpp and .h files of them as well by using the same naming convention mentioned above. If you use standard C++ libraries, you do not need to provide extra files for them.

You will receive zero if your compressed zip file does not expand or it does not contain the correct files. The naming convention of the zip file is the same. The name of the zip file should be as follows:

SUCourseUserName_YourLastname_YourNames_HWnumber.zip

For example, zubzipler_Zipleroglu_Zubeyir_hw2.zip is a valid name, but

Hw2_hoz_HasanOz.zip, HasanOzHoz.zip

are NOT valid names.
